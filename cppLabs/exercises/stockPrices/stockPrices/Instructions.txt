Write a C++ application that meets the following specifications.
Use header files and a driver as appropriate.
Hint: model your application on my code from the knights with file I.O example.
You may copy and paste any code you choose from that source,
including the tokenizer.

A StockPrice has a month, day, and year (all ints), a stock name (string),
an opening price (double), and a closing price(double).
Write code that uses text file I/O to save StockPrices to files and
read them from files.
You may use hard coded data in the same way I do in the knights with
file i/o example; there is no need to take user input for this exercise.
